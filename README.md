# TITLE: MASL 2023-2024 Regular Season Standings
# DESCRIPTION:
The MASL (Major Arena Soccer League) is a professional indoor soccer league with 13 different teams that participated in the 2023-2024 season. Although professional, the skill levels can vary by quite a bit depending on the team.

I created a program called CODE that takes in a CSV file name TEAM_STATS and outputs another CSV file named TEAM_STANDINGS. TEAM_STATS is a list of every team in the MASL, the number of wins and losses the team had, and the goal differential the team ended the 2023/2024 season with. My program will take in TEAM_STATS and convert it to another CSV file that displays the type of record the team had for the season. It will come out to be either winning, loosing, or tying. The reason for this is becuase it is easier to read than a bunch of numbers. TEAM_STANDINGS will also tell the viewer if the goal differential was positive or negative. It will add a "Super" prefix if the the differential is more than plus or minus 25.

I actually play in the MASL and sometimes I forget how each team did the year before. I created this program to get a quick overview of a particular season to either size up my competetion or to have something to talk about when discussing previous matches. I used GitHub and VS Code to code and test everything.
